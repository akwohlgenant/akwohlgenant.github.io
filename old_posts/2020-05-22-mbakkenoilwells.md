## Middle Bakken Oil and Gas Wells Dashboard

This is a dashboard I built in Tableau Public using a dataset downloaded from the North Dakota Oil and Gas Division website (https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/).

The Middle Bakken is the name of the stratigraphic interval targeted by all of the oil and gas wells shown in this dashboard.  The map shows the cumulative oil production for each Middle Bakken well, represented by a colored marker located at each well's surface location. Select an operator and/or a range of completion dates to see the filtered wells and their respective cumulative oil production in the map view.

The format of this blog (or whatever this is called) is pretty narrow, so it doesn't really work well for wide format dashboards like this one.  To view it on the Tableau Public gallery, click the link below.
