I am a geoscientist and data scientist with expertise in data wrangling, machine learning, deep learning, and creating informative visualizations from complex datasets.

I have worked for more than 20 years as a geoscientist in the oil and gas industry in roles ranging from production geologist to geophysicist to reserves consultant.  blah blah blah.
