I am a geoscientist and data enthusiast with interests in data wrangling, machine learning, deep learning, and creating informative visualizations from complex datasets.

I have worked for more than 20 years as a geoscientist in the oil and gas industry in roles ranging from production geologist to geophysicist to reserves consultant.  Recently, I have become more interested in applying open-source technologies to solving real-world problems involving large, complex datasets.  I am not an expert programmer (I'm hardly even a novice programmer), but I enjoy learning new tools to utilize for organizing, cleaning, analyzing, and modeling data.
