I am a geoscientist and data enthusiast with interests in data wrangling, machine learning, deep learning, and creating informative visualizations from complex datasets.

I have worked for more than 20 years as a geoscientist in the oil and gas industry in roles ranging from production geologist to geophysicist to reserves consultant.  Recently, I have become more interested in applying open-source technologies to solving real-world problems involving large, complex datasets.  I am not an expert programmer (I'm hardly even a novice programmer), but I enjoy learning new tools to utilize for organizing, cleaning, analyzing, and modeling data.

This website is a work in progress, but I'm hoping it can serve two function.  First, I hope anyone who is learning about data science, data analytics, visualization, or other data analysis fields might find something useful here.  Second, this site is a place for me to show projects that interest me and the methodoligies I have used to attack problems.  Thanks for visiting!
