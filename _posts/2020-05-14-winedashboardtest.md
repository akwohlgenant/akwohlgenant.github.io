## Wine Data Dashboard

This is a dashboard I built in Tableau using the same dataset as the "Wine Data: Exploratory Analysis in R" post.  I am a relatively new Tableau user, and was I have been investigating how to embed a visualization from Tableau Public into my portfolio site.

This isn't perfect yet, but it could be worse.  Please let me know if you know of a better way to embed on of these into a markdown file!
