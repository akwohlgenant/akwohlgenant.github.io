## Wine Data Dashboard

This is a dashboard I built in Tableau using the same dataset as the "Wine Data: Exploratory Analysis in R" post.  I am just getting started as a Tableau user, and was investigating how to embed a visualization from Tableau Public into my portfolio site.  This is how far I got.  Not great!  I'll keep working on it...
