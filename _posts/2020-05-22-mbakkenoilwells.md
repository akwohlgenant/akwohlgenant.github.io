## Middle Bakken Oil and Gas Wells Dashboard

This is a dashboard I built in Tableau using a dataset downloaded from the North Dakota Oil and Gas Division website (https://www.dmr.nd.gov/oilgas/).

Select an operator and/or a range of completion dates to see the filtered wells and their respective cumulative oil production in the map view.

Please feel free to contact me with any suggestions.  Comment...
