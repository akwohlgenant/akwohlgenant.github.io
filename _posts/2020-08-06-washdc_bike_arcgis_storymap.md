## Bicycle Commuter Incidents in Washington, D.C. and ArcGIS StoryMaps

This is a StoryMap I built as part of a free MOOC course offered by ESRI, **Do-It-Yourself Geo Apps**.  You can find more information on ESRI training on the ESRI ArcGIS online website:

 (<https://www.esri.com/training/catalog/search/>)
 
 Select the MOOC format and toggle 'free' to see this course and some others in the same format.

The StoryMap web application lets users incorporate web maps with text and other forms of media to tell a story.  The course is pretty well put together, and I have found the content to be quite useful.  Check out the story and let me know what you think. I haven't fleshed it out with much more than the bare essentials, but I think it gets across at least a hint of the functionality.
